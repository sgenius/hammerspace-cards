# Hammerspace: special cases

These are not within the main doc to avoid spoilers.

Some cards and situations may be difficult to interpret. Here are some explanations.

## Stealing hidden cards

When stealing cards from other players, you are not allowed to flip any of their hidden cards. You may steal hidden cards, but you won't be allowed to flip it up until it's yours.

Also, when doing this, if you already have a face-down card, the "new card" rule applies: you can hold the stolen card in your hand, facing you, decide if you want to hide the *new* one instead, and if so, flip the new one down and un-hide the old one. 

## Gaining HP via cards

It is possible to gain HP even beyond the initial HP given at the start of the game.

## How Highly Trained Octopus works

You are not restricted to steal all cards from a single player; you can pick and choose from the whole set of cards owned by the players.

## How Formal Attire works

Yes, you actually win the game if you're dressed in full, formal attire, [as described by Debrett's of London](https://www.debretts.com/expertise/etiquette/dress-codes/white-tie/); the description is reproduced here for your convenience:

### White Tie: Men

– A black single-breasted tailcoat in black wool (barathea) or ultrafine herringbone with silk peaked lapels, often grosgrain (worn unbuttoned). The coat is shorter at the front than a morning coat.
– Black trousers with a natural taper and two lines of braid down the outside leg.
– A white marcella (cotton piqué) shirt with a starched detachable wing collar and double cuffs.
– Cufflinks and studs. The shirt will usually be closed with studs rather than buttons. These may be plain white or decorative.
– A low-cut, white marcella evening waistcoat (double or singlebreasted).
– A thin, white hand-tied marcella bow tie.
– Highly polished or patent black lace-up shoes, worn with black laces (traditionally ribbon) and black socks.
– In winter, a black overcoat and white silk scarf may be worn.

### White Tie: Women

– Full-length, formal evening dresses. It is traditional, but not essential, to show décolletage. Shorter dresses or trousers, no matter how smart, are not acceptable.
– Jewellery can be striking; this is the time for the finest jewels and gems, including tiaras. Traditionally these are worn for the first time by brides, and subsequently by married women only. It is incorrect for young girls to wear tiaras on any occasion.
– Evening bags should be small and elegant.

### Permissible variation

The only permissible variation to this rule is as follows: The original language of this game is Spanish, and in some Spanish variants, the white tie is called *traje de pingüino* (penguin's suit). For this reason, **a full-body penguin's mascot costume of the plush variety** will also be accepted.

## How Hypnosis works

Choose a player. Then, choose one of the attack cards of that player. Have that player roll the attack dice and sum attack points. Then that same player will have to roll for his/her own defense. **For all effects, you're making a player attack him/herself, as if him/her had started the attack,** except that you're calling the shots.

If the attack card should hit two adjacent players, choose who will also get hit. If it should attack all players, it will hit all players (and you too). 

Note that you cannot activate any of that player's ability cards. His/her trait effects, however, do apply.

## How Merry-Go-Round works

Choose a card from the player at your right. This card will substitute the Merry-Go-Round card that you just used, so you will remain with four cards. 

Then the player at your right will do the same; the card that s/he chooses will again complete his/her four card hand.

The last player to do this will naturally be the one at your left. Note that there is no rule against this player to rob you the card that you just got. This is intentional and should be interpreted as a valuable life lesson.

## "But I don't want to lose my golem!"

The rules state that if youre being attacked, you must do your best to defend yourself with all matching cards first.

The golem will naturally attract most attacks, given that it gives 10 defense points of any kind. So if you have your golem face up, the only way to keep it for more than one attack is to somehow cover completely the attack points (attack card + attack dice roll) with the sum of defense points from other defense cards, if you have them.

By the way, these golems are humongous magical creatures, made up of rock and steel, with eyes like flames, feared and revered by anything and anyone that crosses their path. They like puppies and long strolls on the beach. In some nights they get together to smash themselves in furious tournaments and after that they have tea and crumpets. 

## The Invincible Cape

It's *invincible*, not *invisible*. I know what you're thinking. We don't want any *copyrighto lawsuitus* spells.

## How Macaroni, Spoon and Cheese work together

The three cards have to be in your hand, face up, at the same time, to be usable.

Using these cards counts as your action for this turn.

You immediately recover HP up to the quantity of HP you had at the beginning of the game. You also discard the three cards, which means you get three new ones.

Yes, while you're collecting the set, the cards will be there, wasting space. But it's been known to pay out in the end.

## The Economist Trait

If you have this trait, roll the dice after you attacked. Get a 5 or 6 and you conserve your attack card. 

If you forget to roll the dice and your turn ends, too bad: you don't get to recover that lost roll.

## The Berserk Trait

If you have this trait, it is not obligatory for you to activate its clause. You *can* lose 1 HP in exchange of +1 attack point, but you're not required to.

You should announce you're using your trait this before or while attacking. Once the defense starts, you can no longer claim it.

By the way, you can still do this if you only have 1 HP remaining. In that case, you attack first, then you die immediately after.

## The Resourceful Trait

Let's say it's your turn, and you do have one attack card, but it's hidden (face down) and you don't want to flip it up. You can legally use the trait to change other cards in your hand.

## The Pacifist Trait

If you attacked someone against your will (eg. someone used Hypnosis on you), this trait is now inactive.

However, if you caused damage by deflecting an attack (eg. with a Mirror), you still get +3 any defense, because strictly speaking you did not attack anyone.
